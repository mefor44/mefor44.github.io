## Why
Recommender systems aim at providing personalized product suggestions to customers. In the era of gargantuan numbers of different products choosing the right one for you can be an arduous task [paradox of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice). Recommender systems aim to solve this problem. Having access to user browse history, demographical data, items characteristics it aims at reducing the space of items to only few relevant (usually 10,20,...). Big retailers often rely on them. On Amazon 35% of their products are bought from recommendations produced by their recomenmder systems. For Netflix this number is even more substantial [more here](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers).
 Product recommendation is a complex problem. Preparing a list of products is just one of the steps. Website design, how each product will be presented, how many products to show, etc. all play vital role in succesful product recommendations. In this tutorial will be be only considering how to prepare personalized recommendation list.
