<p>👋 Hi! My name is Mateusz Marzec, and I am a Research Engineer at <a href="https://ml.allegro.tech/" target="_blank">Allegro</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I love practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu 🥋 and playing board games 🎲.</p>
<p>At work, I focus on making recommender systems better 🤖. During that process, I read a lot of research papers 📚 related to this topic, and I decided to create a blog 📝 to share the knowledge I gain with others—specifically technical people who are looking for new ideas 💡 but don’t want to dive deep into the academic papers.</p>
